## About Me
Hello, there. Iâ€™m David, a full stack web developer passionate about creating engaging user experiences. In 2024 I gained a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development from the Code Institute as a means of entering into the world of software development after over a decade of working in the retail and customer service industry. The largest projects of the course specialised in use of the Django framework and I'm currently developing my portfolio projects while looking for work of entry level or beyond.

Trivia Survivor is a movie trivia quiz game with an element of danger. Players will test their knowledge of movie trivia as a creature makes its way towards them. Correct answers will stall the creatures approach while incorrect answers will allow it to advance. When too many wrong answers have been submitted the game ends in failure so to survive players must answer enough trivia questions correctly.
